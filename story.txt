Frank Jones has always loved Boise, Idaho with its 172 landfills. It was a place where he felt alive.
He liked to imagine himself as a witty, wild man of class. His friends saw him as a spineless coward but loved him regardless. 
Once, he kicked a puppy, just to know what it felt like but that's the sort of man Mr Jones was.
