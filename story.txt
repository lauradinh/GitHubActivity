Frank Jones has always loved Boise, Idaho with its 172 landfills. It was a place where he felt alive.
He liked to imagine himself as a witty, wild man of class. His friends saw him as a spineless coward but loved him regardless. 
Once, he kicked a puppy, just to know what it felt like but that's the sort of man Mr. Jones was.
It was common for Mr. Jones to dissapear from town for weeks at a time. He'd often come back bruised and bloody, and refuse to answer any questions about where he had been.
It came as no surprise, then, when Mr. Jones up and left town. But this time was different.
